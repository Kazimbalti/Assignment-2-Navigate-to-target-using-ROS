# Assignment-2-Navigate-to-target-using-ROS
Use Rosparam to change the location of your target (a parameter for each coordinate: x and y) and to define the radius that defines the threshold within which the target is considered reached. Create a node called "turtle_guide_to_xy" that guides the turtle to the target location. Link https://youtu.be/1fjvXMGLQGg
